ivy-python's documentation
==========================

`ivy (or ivybus) <https://www.eei.cena.fr/products/ivy/>`_ is a lightweight
software bus for quick-prototyping protocols. It allows
applications to broadcast information through text messages, with
a subscription mechanism based on regular expressions.

This is the python implementation.  A lot of materials, including
libraries for many languages are available from the `Ivy (ivybus) Home
Page <https://www.eei.cena.fr/products/ivy/>`_.

Useful links:

- The `ivy-python package in the Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ivy-python>`_
- The `ivy-python online documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/ivy-python/>`_
